Software visualization provides methods to make algorithms and programs more understandable. Allowing a user to interact with dynamically changing graphical representations of algorithms or data structures can be helpful in teaching, research, or systems programming. For example, a sorting algorithm could be animated by a sequence of frames displaying a set of vertical lines of different heights, permuted in an order of increasing height. Such animations are useful for developing new programs, for debugging, and for explaining how programs work.
A web-based animation tool was created to visualize four common sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort. The animation tool would represent data as a bar-graph and after selecting a data-ordering and algorithm, the user can run an automated animation or step through it at their own pace.
languages used html,css,javascript and bootstrap to develop a system.
